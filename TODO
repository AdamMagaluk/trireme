zlib:
  Need it for express
fs: 
  Need it for express -- complete it
https:
  Need it

cluster:
  Same -- let's do it inside a JVM.

  Complete it.

  Use the JS
domain:
  May need more module support.

  Use the JS?

  Probably won't be used directly.

  Not gonna be relevant in the cloud -- low priority.
